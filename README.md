Learning Android
================

Hi, I'm Chris. I work at TripAdvisor on our mobile apps, and up to this point have been focusing on iOS as the iOS technical manager. Now I'm trying to learn android development, and am (slowly, where time permits) working my through [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide] (http://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333), and I'm tracking my progress here.

## Why?
Why am I putting this on github? A few reasons

1. Maybe others can benefit from my learnings. My goal is to be overly-thorough in my usage of commits and tags to allow people to jump in, while also adding key learnings that are quickly digestible (not needing to read the whole book)
2. My making this public, I'm creating a social contract and hope it will discourage me from procrastinating
3. It gives me an excuse to practice my markdown...

## Format
I'll tag my progress after each chapter, and maybe even add a commit for subsections. I'll also add other notes to this readme about other important things learned (or keep a short list of subtleties I miss or where things different from iOS development.)

I started late, so you won't see any commits / tags for the first few chapters.

## Notes
(I may move this to a "notes" directory with more structure. But I'll throw it all here to avoid pre-optimizations).
